# Counter

Counter is a [tally counter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_counter) for Android. It
makes counting easier. You can have multiple counters with their own names and values. Values can be
changed using volume buttons.

**This project is no longer in active development! I have more important things in my life to work
on. If you want to contribute a feature or fix a problem, please create a pull request.**

This was my first Android application. The goal was to make something useful and easy to build.
Counter is available on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.tsukanov.counter)
and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=me.tsukanov.counter).

I hope you'll find this project useful.
